## 🎮 Game Architecture

### Core Components

```javascript
// Main game systems
const gameArchitecture = {
  gameState: "Central state management with reactive updates",
  renderEngine: "Canvas 2D with optimized drawing operations", 
  inputSystem: "Unified mouse/touch handling with gesture support",
  levelGenerator: "Procedural pattern creation with difficulty scaling",
  particleSystem: "Efficient object pooling for visual effects",
  audioEngine: "Web Audio API integration (planned)",
  saveSystem: "LocalStorage with data compression"
};
```

### Performance Features
- **60fps Target**: Optimized game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- **Object Pooling**: Efficient memory management for particles
- **Smart Rendering**: Only redraw changed elements when possible
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-specific optimizations and responsive design
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and garbage collection prevention

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- Text editor or IDE
- Local web server (optional but recommended)

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
git clone https://github.com/AndersPier/neural-nexus-game.git
cd neural-nexus-game

# 2. Start local development server
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx http-server

# 3. Open in browser with DevTools
open http://localhost:8000

# 4. Make changes to index.html
# 5. Refresh browser to test changes
# 6. Commit changes regularly
```

### Code Organization

The game is currently built as a single `index.html` file containing:
- **HTML Structure**: Game container and UI elements
- **CSS Styling**: Modern design with CSS custom properties
- **JavaScript Logic**: Game engine, classes, and event handling

```javascript
// Key classes and systems
class GameState { /* Central state management */ }
class Node { /* Game node entities */ }
class Connection { /* Node connection logic */ }
class ParticleSystem { /* Visual effects */ }

// Main game loop
function gameLoop() { /* Rendering and updates */ }
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Target Specifications
| Metric | Desktop | Mobile | Requirement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Frame Rate | 60 FPS | 30+ FPS | Consistent |
| Load Time | <2s | <3s | Initial load |
| Memory Usage | <100MB | <50MB | During gameplay |
| Bundle Size | <1MB | <1MB | Total assets |

### Optimization Techniques
- Canvas rendering optimizations
- Efficient event handling with throttling
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Smart asset loading and caching strategies
- Mobile-specific touch optimizations

## 🚀 Deployment

### Web Hosting
```bash
# Static hosting options:
- GitHub Pages: Zero-config deployment
- Netlify: Drag-and-drop deployment
- Vercel: Git integration with auto-deploys
- AWS S3 + CloudFront: Scalable CDN hosting
```

### Progressive Web App
```bash
# Convert to PWA:
1. Add manifest.json for app-like experience
2. Implement service worker for offline play
3. Add install prompts for mobile/desktop
4. Enable push notifications (optional)
```
